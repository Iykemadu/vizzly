= Introduction =

This page describes the JSON notation used for specifying visualization widgets. The definition of the canvas and the signals that should be plotted is independent of the type of the widget, i.e., time series or map widget. The type of widget is then determined by the chosen function call used for populating the canvas area.

== General graph/canvas properties ==

{{{
// Definition of a graph, same format for time series and map widgets
g1Config = {
    // Properties of viewing canvas
    "graph": {
        // ID of the <div> element into which the graph is embedded
        "div": "g1_div",
        // Width and height of the graph in pixels
        "width": 600,
        "height": 250,
        // Enable/disable signal selection form in time series plot
        "showForm": false
    },
    // URL of Java Servlet, e.g. http://vizzly.server:8080/vizzly?
    "appUrl": "vizzly?",
    // Base URL for images
    "imageUrl" : "./images/",
    // Initial center position of map widget
    "mapCenter": new google.maps.LatLng(47.379022, 8.541001),
    // Array of signals that should be shown in this plot
    "signals": []
}
